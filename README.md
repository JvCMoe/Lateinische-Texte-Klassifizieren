# Lateinische-Texte-Klassifizieren
I have tried to train an artificial neural network to decide, if a given text in latin language is written in the classical time of the roman empire or in the middle ages.

The file attached is a zipped directory containing the Python code and all files and subdirectories needed. 

The main result was:

1.) Trained with a broad mixture of different authors from different centuries the network is not able to detect patterns or rules, it can only guess.

2.) Trained with two selected authors, the network is abel to detect the difference, but with clear overfitting.
